         <h4><i>Raytracing With Doom</i></h4>
         <hr class="solid">
         <article>
             Everyone's heard about the new Graphics Fad going around: Some engineers have figured out how to double
             the transistors within a single board, allowing for new innovations like waving hair, useless particle effects,
             or better yet, raytracing. But wait a minute, Raytracing? Useless? Well, not particularly...

             <br><br>

             Raytracing has been a topic within computer graphics for a long time, oftentimes considered to be an unattainable feat for Personal Computers
             due to the requirements of performance: in the mid 1980s for instance, consumer systems like the Commodore Amiga could only render ray-tracing
             frames very, very excruciatingly slowly. And even then, it would take a lot of time to display the pre-rendered result, let alone
             actively render a ray-traced scene in real time. Thus, the standard for computer graphics in the consumer industry was known as rasterization - the
             process of taking an image based off of data segments (shapes, vectors, and lines), and then converting it into a pixel-by pixel image. Raytracing on
             the other hand, renders images through the natural propagation of light, something which requires intense calculations per frame. This has made
             the realm of Raytraced graphics a phenomenon only seen in the CGI industry, where developers almost always had access to the latest workstations
             of the era.

             <br><br>

             However, new cards developed by Nvidia can make the concept of raytraced real-time graphics a reality. Starting with the 1660 series onwards which
             contains the "Turing Micro-architecture", these cards can perform ray-tracing calculations for the games which support it. For the topic of this article,
             we will look at the classic FPS "Doom", which has a new source-port designed to take advantage of the new architecture found within these GPUs.

             <br><br>

             Doom was always known for it's sector-based lighting which while dynamic, was entirely based off of node-defined sectors, and had little consideration
             for dynamic lights. The Raytracing engine allows the sectors to still utilize lighting, but also contains calculations which perform "light bounces"
             across the level, allowing for dynamic reflections and lights. Additionally, material pipelines are added for each and every texture, meaning that
             different surfaces have different emissive properties (Something which was never programmed within the original doom engine).

             <br><br>
             The effect is stunning, but at the same time, jarring at high resolutions. There's a particular zen with playing doom at it's intended 300x220
             resolution, where every sprite and object feels in-line with the experience. As you increase the resolution, the immersion seems to decrease. The
             raytracing engine, while very impressive and wondrous in its own right, has its flaws where it can't recreate the original atmosphere of the game in
             some places. With that being said, when you set the renderer to a lower resolution, then it indeed feels more immersive.


             <br><br>
             The source port can be picked up from github and is only tailored to play with the first 4 episodes of the Ultimate Doom, which is easy to get on
             Steam or GOG. It can also work with other WADs which use the same IWAD, which means that Doom 2 will probably have the proper lighting, but won't
             work well.

             <h4><i>Retro Computers: A Treasure Trove of Lost Knowledge, and their Legacy</i></h4>
             <hr class="solid">
             <article>
                 Many people growing up in the 80s or 90s remember the age of Micro-Computers: When they were around the same size, sometimes contained
                 within a single unit, and often had very, very steep learning curves to them. For instance, when the ZX-Spectrum released in the 1980s (I am
                 not speaking from experience), it was often contained within a kit which you had to build - and then when you got the thing working (which never
                 works out properly if you solder in your spare time), then you had to learn how to write programs. In an age when computers were reaching the
                 mainstream, the public had to learn how to program them due to the knowledge only being accessible to companies and universities. For many young
                 people like myself, such a truth is hard to imagine when learning about programming or electronics these days is extremely simple - and even
                 when the spirit of hobbyist computing is preserved with the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi, many older folks grew up with long, long nights of
                 reading thick manuals describing BASIC or C Programs, only to type them out on the command line to have it fail.

                 <br><br>

                 Of course, anyone who has programmed in vim or nano (My Junior semester taking a Linux Programming Course) will still experience the feeling of
                 typing an entire program from scratch, only to have it fail when you type the dreaded "gcc -o Hello.c Hello.exe" on their command line. But many
                 things are being lost to newer generations as computers become more complex; Case in Point: Assembly. Once a fundamental language which allowed
                 programmers to write complex and efficient programs, is now pretty much useless (to learn) as any modern compiler generates optimized machine-code on the fly.
                 Now of course, you will need to know assembly to understand how a computer receives and computes data, the concept of a PC counter, the Stack Pointer,
                 registers and what they correspond to, among many other things; but besides this you will never learn how to fully program in assembly due to it's
                 sheer magnitude. Besides, who actually wants to program a 3d game in assembly these days?

                 <br><br>

                 Despite all this, it's important to recognize the feats of these ancient computers and what they cemented for newer generations: a long-standing
                 tradition of programming, finding out how to do things, and persistent innovation.
